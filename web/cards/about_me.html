      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer and computer science student currently living
        in Pullman, Washington. When it comes to my professional work,
        coding is what I do best, and my primary
        interests are in Android and the web. My two biggest gripes with
        software today are overly complicated user experiences, and bugs that
        do nothing but to grind you down. For these reasons among others,
        I'm carefully attentive to
        the quality of code that I write and the experience it creates for the
        user. I believe code is in itself art, so please, feel free to check
        out
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanPowers" target="_blank">my github</a>
        and, if you are interested, the
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanPowers/dylanpowers.github.io" target="_blank">
          source for this website</a>.

      <p>
        Currently, I'm taking a break from school to pursue my own educational
        endeavors and gain back my sanity. I've completed four
        years of college with two more to go until I complete my
        B.S. in Computer Science, and with school costing twice as much as it did
        when I started, I've grown to be a bit discouraged. I'm definitely looking
        for employment and if you're interested in
        what I can do for you, please contact me! I'm primarily interested in
        relocating to Seattle or working remotely.
