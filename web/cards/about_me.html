      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer and computer science student currently living
        in Pullman, Washington. When it comes to my professional work,
        coding is what I do best, and my primary
        interests are in Android and the web. I &#9829; open source software and
        I primarily do my computing on Linux distro's
        and frequently rock my own build of Cyanogenmod on my phone. I take
        pride in the work I do and I'm carefully attentive to
        the quality of code that I write and the experience it creates for the
        user. To see what I've been working on lately, please feel free to check
        out
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanPowers" target="_blank">my github</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I may still be in school completing my CS degree, but I'm definitely
        looking for employment opportunities and if you're interested in
        what I can do for you, please contact me! While I'm primarily interested
        in relocating to Seattle, I'd be open to other cities.
