      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer and computer science student currently living
        in Pullman, Washington. When it comes to my professional work,
        coding is what I do best, and my primary
        interests are in Android and the web. Yes, I &#9829; Google and am
        committed to open source software. I primarily do my computing in
        Linux distro's
        and frequently rock my own build of Cyanogenmod on my phone.
      </p>

        My two biggest gripes with
        software today are overly complicated user experiences, and those
        little bugs that strike day in and day out until finally, on a
        particularly touchy day, the urge to through the computer out the
        window has reached its boiling point and we find ourselves on Amazon
        buying a
        new one. For these reasons among others,
        I'm carefully attentive to
        the quality of code that I write and the experience it creates for the
        user. I believe code is in itself art, so please, feel free to check
        out
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanPowers" target="_blank">my github</a>
        for the projects I've been working on lately.
      </p>

        Currently, I'm taking a break from school to pursue my own educational
        endeavors and gain back my sanity. I've completed four
        years of college with two more to go until I complete my
        B.S. in Computer Science, and with school costing twice as much as it did
        when I started,
        <a href="https://medium.com/@dylankpowers/im-kinda-done-with-college-1d2027869881"
           target="_blank">
          I'm not going back if I can help it</a>.
        I'm definitely looking
        for employment and if you're interested in
        what I can do for you, please contact me! I'm primarily interested in
        relocating to Seattle or working remotely.
