      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <p>
        Hardware wise, I keep it cheap. My primary on the go device is my
        13in Toshiba Chromebook 2. I love Chromebooks. They're cheap machines,
        no frills, and run Linux like a boss. This one has a rather beautiful
        1080p IPS display that I love. It's a little underpowered, but that's
        why I have a desktop. The point is, I can get all day battery life
        from this little sucker. My desktop has an i5 Haswell CPU and a
        Nvidia 760 GPU with an SSD and spinning disks for extra space. It does
        everything I need it too with plenty of power to spare.

      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>
        On the software side, I love Linux. Ubuntu is my distro of choice simply
        because it is very stable and generally, everyone who makes a piece of
        software for Linux has a debian package somewhere. For my window manager,
        I use Awesome. It is not perfect, but does the job and tiling window
        managers are the best for productivity. I'm also an IDE person. I get a
        lot of flack for it, but nothing beats a good IDE like Intellij's
        IDEA Ultimate. What I love about it is that I can get into any
        development environment with the installation of a few plugins. Plus,
        it's highly configurable so I can turn off the annoying bits.
