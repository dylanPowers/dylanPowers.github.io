      <h3>Spotigoo (Work in progress)</h3>

      <h3>WSU 2015 Hackathon Website</h3>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="http://hackathon.eecs.wsu.edu" target="_blank">WSU 2015 Hackathon</a>
        needs a website, and I have provided most of the
        work to facilitate that. It's a no-nonsense implementation made for
        modern browsers that can run scriptless which feels like an
        notable achievement for 2014. Who creates a website without scripts and
        can properly handle both desktops and screens as small as the tiny
        iPhone 4? We can.

      <h3>This website</h3>
      <p>
        This site was an effort by me to sort of push the browser boundaries.
        It's implemented
        in Dart with the web components framework Polymer and deployed as
        a Github page. A lot of complexity could
        have been reduced by simplifying the header, but I really wanted to
        create something that showcases how I think website headers should
        work. For that reason, it doesn't work as beautifully as it could on
        mobile due to the low frequency of scroll events mobile browsers send.
        The design is heavily influenced by Android and Google's
        Material Design.

      <h3>Pandoroid</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanPowers/pandoroid" target="_blank">Pandoroid</a>
        is an Android app that utilizes a reverse engineering of Pandora's
        JSON-RPC APIs to bring
        the same high quality
        audio found in their desktop app to mobile. It also has a few playback
        tricks under the hood like bandwidth analysis to bring the
        best audio available for the current network conditions
        and next song pre-caching for consistant playback under intermittent
        network conditions.

          It took some work
          figuring out how to get the Android Gradle build system
          to work with the NDK at the time because it was still in beta and
          not officially supported.
