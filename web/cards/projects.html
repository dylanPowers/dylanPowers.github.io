      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h3>Hackathon 2015 Website</h3>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="http://hackathon.eecs.wsu.edu" target="_blank">2015 Hackathon</a>
        needs a website, and I have provided most of the
        work to facilitate that. It's a no-nonsense implementation made for
        modern browsers that can run scriptless which feels like an
        notable achievement for 2014. Who creates a website without scripts and
        can properly handle both desktops and screens as small as the tiny
        iPhone 4? We can.

      <h3>This website</h3>
      <p>
        This site was an effort by me to sort of push the browser boundaries.
        It's nothing special and implemented
        in Dart and the web components framework Polymer. A lot of complexity could
        have been reduced by simplifying the header, but I really wanted to
        create something that showcases how I think website headers should
        work. The design is heavily influenced by Android and Google's
        Material Design.

      <h3>Pandoroid</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanPowers/pandoroid" target="_blank">Pandoroid</a>
        is an Android app that utilizes a reverse engineering of Pandora's
        JSON-RPC APIs to bring
        the same high quality
        audio found in their desktop app to mobile. It also had a few playback
        tricks under the hood like bandwidth analysis to bring the
        best audio available for the current network conditions
        and next song pre-caching for consistant playback under intermittent
        network conditions.
