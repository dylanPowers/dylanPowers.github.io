      <h2>WSU 2015 Hackathon Website</h2>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="http://hackathon.eecs.wsu.edu" target="_blank">WSU 2015 Hackathon</a>
        needs a website, and I have contributed a lot of
        work to facilitate that. Most of my work has centered around mobile
        optimizations and improving the deployment process.

      <h2 class="no-print">This website</h2>
      <h2 class="print-only">My website</h2>
      <p>
        This site is an effort by me to sort of push the browser boundaries.
        It's implemented
        in Dart with the web components framework Polymer and deployed as
        a Github page. A lot of complexity could
        have been reduced by simplifying the header, but I really wanted to
        create something that showcases how I think website headers should
        work. My only disappointment is that it doesn't work
        as beautifully as it could on
        mobile due to the low frequency of scroll events mobile browsers send.
        The design is heavily influenced by Android and Google's
        Material Design.

      <h2>Pandoroid</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanPowers/pandoroid" target="_blank">Pandoroid</a>
        is an Android app that utilizes a reverse engineering of Pandora's
        JSON-RPC APIs to bring
        the same high quality
        audio found in their desktop app to mobile. It also has a few playback
        tricks under the hood like bandwidth analysis to bring the
        best audio available for the current network conditions
        and next song pre-caching for consistant playback under intermittent
        network conditions. I've left Pandora behind however for other services
        so work on this has been stale for a couple of years.

      <h2>IPFS Android</h2>
      <p>
        This is a quick and dirty app I created that makes accessing files
        on IPFS slightly easier on Android. All it does is allow you to
        input an IPFS hash by either manually pasting it in or handling intents
        for the URI scheme "ipfs://&lt;hash&gt;[/&lt;filePath&gt;]"
        and redirecting requests to an HTTP server hosting IPFS.
      </p>
      <p>
        For fun, you may also find a version of this website on IPFS at

      <h2>Spotigoo (Work in progress)</h2>
      <p>
        An Android app that aids in transitioning between Spotify
        and Google Music by migrating playlists and libraries between the two.
        It's still very much a concept.

            This was a rather long bug hunt and a brutal 1 week crash course into
            Android system development. However, I really wanted to learn
            Android at the system level, so I killed two birds with one stone.
            This was also my first time navigating a large code base, and in this
            case an incredibly massive one.

            Nothing significant, but I was doing a class on desktop
            OpenGL in C++ and really wanted to do something on my phone.
            It took some work
            figuring out how to get the Android Gradle build system
            to work with the NDK at the time because it was still in beta and
            not officially supported.
