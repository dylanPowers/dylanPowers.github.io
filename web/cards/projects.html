      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h3>Pandoroid</h3>
      <p>
        Reverse engineering of Pandora's API's to bring the same high quality
        audio found in their desktop app to mobile. Also analysed available
        bandwidth to bring the best audio available for the current cellular
        connection while also pre-caching the next song for consistant playback.

      <h3>Hackathon 2015 Website</h3>
      <p>
        The 2015 Hackathon needed a website, and I have provided most of the
        work to facilitate that. It's a no-nonsense implementation made for
        modern browsers that can run scriptless which feels like an
        notable achievement for 2014. Who creates a website without scripts and
        can properly handle both desktops and screens as small as the tiny
        iPhone 4? I can.

      <h3>This website</h3>
      <p>
        This site was an effort by me to sort of push the browser boundaries.
        Mobile browsers ended up annoying me the most as they don't trigger
        their scroll updates as often as they should, but it's implemented
        in the Dart web components framework Polymer and I'm very happy with
        it. It really symbolizes what I see as being a state of the art
        web app.
