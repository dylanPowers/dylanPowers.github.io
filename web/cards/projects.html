            This was a rather long bug hunt and a brutal 1 week crash course into
            Android system development. However, I really wanted to learn
            Android at the system level, so I killed two birds with one stone.
            This was also my first time navigating a large code base, and in this
            case an incredibly massive one.

            Nothing significant, but I was doing a class on desktop
            OpenGL in C++ and really wanted to do something on my phone.
            It took some work
            figuring out how to get the Android Gradle build system
            to work with the NDK at the time because it was still in beta and
            not officially supported.

        The 2015
        <a href="http://hackathon.eecs.wsu.edu" target="_blank">WSU Hackathon</a>
        needed a website, and I contributed a lot of
        work to facilitate that. It is largely a joint effort between
        <a href="http://bahm.io" target="_blank">Alex Bahm</a> and I, and as
        with any small team, I've touched pretty much every piece of it. With
        the amount of work we've put in, I'm just happy that it can be used as
        a foundation for many hackathons to come.

      <h2 class="print-only">My website</h2>
      <p class="no-print">
        This site is an effort by me to sort of push the browser boundaries.
        It's implemented
        in Dart with the web components framework Polymer and deployed as
        a Github page. A lot of complexity could
        have been reduced by simplifying the header, but I really wanted to
        create something that showcases how I think website headers should
        work. <span class="no-print">My only disappointment is that it doesn't work
        as beautifully as it could on
        mobile due to the low frequency of scroll events mobile browsers send.</span>
        The design is heavily influenced by Android and Google's
        Material Design.

      <h2>Pandoroid</h2>
      <p class="no-print">
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanPowers/pandoroid" target="_blank">Pandoroid</a>
        is an Android app that utilizes a reverse engineering of Pandora's
        JSON-RPC APIs to bring
        the same high quality
        audio found in their desktop app to mobile. It also has a few playback
        tricks under the hood like bandwidth analysis to bring the
        best audio available for the current network conditions
        and next song pre-caching for consistant playback under intermittent
        network conditions. I've left Pandora behind however for other services
        so work on this has been stale for a couple of years.

      <h2 id="ipfs-chrome-extension">IPFS Chrome Extension</h2>
      <p class="no-print">
        <a href="https://ipfs.io" target="_blank">IPFS</a> is a new P2P technology
        that has caught my interest. I'd describe it as a modernized and
        user friendly version of BitTorrent. Using it is as simple as visiting
        <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipns/QmSJ5B27yQe9bDLmwqF4FxJpBBcpxMnK9uJwX8qbQUyycN/#ipfs-chrome-extension">
          https://ipfs.io/ipns/QmSJ5B27yQe9bDLmwqF4FxJpBBcpxMnK9uJwX8qbQUyycN
        </a>.
        This extension extends the user friendliness by enabling users of
        IPFS to use it in a distributed fashion, like it is meant to be used,
        while also providing backwards compatibility with the current web.
        In direct terms, this extension redirects requests to
        http://gateway.ipfs.io/ to a locally running IPFS daemon. For more
        details, check out the source.
