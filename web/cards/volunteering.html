          I feel that everyone has an obligation to give back to the communities
          they live in because it's those communities that are what help us as
          individuals prosper. For me, I do this through what I know best,
          my knowledge of programming. Besides my open source software
          contributions, and small bits of writing that can be found on
          <a href="https://medium.com/@dylankpowers" target="_blank">Medium</a>
          and my
          <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DylanPowersz" target="_blank">Google+</a>
          page, I also like to help others
          by teaching. In the WSU spring 2013 semester I voluntarily instructed
          a lab section for an
          intro level computer science class that teaches C. During that time
          I learned a lot about how to think differently through seemingly
          simple problems and debug some absolutely horrendous code.

          Currently I help with ACM tutoring for 3 hours on Sundays. This
          tutoring session is for
          computer science students that need help with their coursework. I've
          been doing this since fall of 2014.

        <h2 class="org">WSU ACM Chapter</h2>
        <h3 class="date">May 2015 - Present</h3>
        <h3 class="position">Treasurer</h3>
        <p>
          This position carries a lot of responsibility. Currently I'm 1 of 3
          officers. I'm not only in charge
          of the finances of 3 different club accounts, I'm also in charge of
          collaborating closely with the WSU school of EECS. This position also
          carries the responsibility of taking on any other miscellaneous
          challenges the WSU ACM organization might face.

        <h2 class="org">WSU Hackathon</h2>
        <h3 class="date">Fall 2014 - Present</h3>
        <h3 class="position">Organizer</h3>
        <p>
          The 2nd annual hackathon was my first hackathon. That took place in
          2013. For the 3rd annual hackathon I wanted to help out. For that
          hackathon I provided
          assistance on the website and day-of operations. For the 4th annual
          WSU Hackathon, which will be renamed shortly, I am a lead organizer.
          This means I'm in charge of everything that goes into a hackathon:
          sponsors, participants, day-of operations, etc.
