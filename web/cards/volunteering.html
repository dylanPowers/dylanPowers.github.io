        I feel that everyone has an obligation to give back to the communities
        they live in because it's those communities that are what help us as
        individuals prosper. For me, I do this through what I know best,
        my knowledge of programming. Besides my open source software
        contributions, and small bits of writing that can be found on
        <a href="https://medium.com/@dylankpowers" target="_blank">Medium</a>
        and my
        <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DylanPowersz" target="_blank">Google+</a>
        page, I also like to help others
        by teaching. In the WSU spring 2013 semester I voluntarily instructed
        a lab section for an
        intro level computer science class and this past
        academic year (2014 - 2015) I've
        helped with ACM tutoring on weekends for computer science students that
        need homework help.

        Currently I'm the treasurer for the 2015-2016 WSU ACM chapter and will
        be a lead organizer of the annual WSU Hackathon in the early spring.
