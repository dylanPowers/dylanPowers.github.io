        This is a part time position where my primary goal is to foster an open
        and inclusive community that encourages people to engage in the project
        and feel welcome. My roles primarily consist of listening and replying
        to community feedback on various mailing lists, articles, and the IRC
        channel; improving upon
        the documentation and examples to help get people started; and finding
        usability issues within the IPFS app itself that the developers may
        have missed.

        During my time at SEL, while I did create a couple of shipping features,
        most of my work was done on prototypal applications that were centered
        around
        <a href="https://www.selinc.com/SEL-5078-2/"
           target="_blank">
          SynchroWAVe Central</a>

        This was my first software engineering internship and I got quite lucky
        working in a pretty innovative group within SEL.
        <span class="no-print">I ended up
        leaving because I decided I could no longer work while also doing
        classes and I wanted to move on to working in Seattle for the next

          A few prototype
          mobile and HTML5 apps to investigate moving away from Silverlight.
          <span class="no-print">Our team got caught in the Silverlight end of
          life downfall, plus we
          wanted to explore supporting more platforms.</span>
          These prototypes included weighing various
          languages against each other and the incumbent C#, and
          benchmarking the performance next to Silverlight.

          A couple of new charts implemented in Silverlight for

        <li>
          A desperately needed redesign of the web API that fully leverages
          REST principals to increase
          multiplatform interoperability. The original API was .NET
          autogenerated gunk that was undocumented and incompatible with other
          languages/frameworks. I
          happily fixed it up while gaining a very deep understanding of
          what it takes to architect a RESTful API.
