        This was a contract based job that consisted of working on two
        applications: one being a website written in PHP and the other an
        Android app.
        The website is a pre-existing application at
        <a href="http://serc.wsu.edu" target="_blank">serc.wsu.edu</a> that
        I made improvements to. While my changes are still pending and
        aren't live at the moment, those
        improvements most notably consisted
        of improving mobile friendliness, sprucing up the look, and adding a
        couple of sections with additional information.
        The Android app however you can see right now on
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adaptelligence.wumpusWorld&hl=en"
           target="_blank">Google Play</a> and is called Wumpus World. It was
        previously implemented in Objective-C on iOS and I ported it to C++ so
        it can be platform agnostic and run on Android.

          A desperately needed redesign of the web API that fully leverages
          REST principals to increase
          multiplatform interoperability. The original API was .NET
          autogenerated gunk that was undocumented and incompatible with other
          languages/frameworks. I
          happily fixed it up while gaining a very deep understanding of
          what it takes to architect a RESTful API.</span>
