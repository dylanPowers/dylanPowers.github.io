        During my time at SEL, while I did create a couple of shipping features,
        most of my work was done on prototypal applications that were centered
        around
        <a href="https://www.selinc.com/SEL-5078-2/"
           target="_blank">
          SynchroWAVe Central</a>
        and

          SynchroWAVe Event</a>.
        This was my first software engineering internship and I got quite lucky
        working in a pretty innovative group within SEL. I ended up
        leaving because I decided I could no longer work while also doing
        classes and I wanted to move on to working in Seattle for the next
        summer (2015).

          A few prototype
          mobile and HTML5 apps to investigate moving away from Silverlight.
          Our team got caught in the Silverlight end of life downfall, plus we
          wanted to explore supporting more platforms.
          These prototypes included weighing various
          languages against each other and the incumbent C#
          (Javascript didn't come out too well), and
          benchmarking the performance next to Silverlight.

          A couple of new charts implemented in Silverlight for

          and FFT plots are, then congrats! You'll have a better appreciation of
          the work I did. Otherwise know that I have the most beautiful and
          intuitive mho circle in the industry.

          A desperately needed redesign of the web API that fully leverages
          REST principals to increase
          multiplatform interoperability. The original API was .NET
          autogenerated
          gunk that was undocumented and didn't practice good programming
          practices. In .NET everything looked workable, but when
          using it with other languages/frameworks, it was a complete mess. I
          happily fixed it up while gaining a very deep understanding of
          what it takes to architect a RESTful API.
